### The Food and Agriculture Biomass Input-Output database

FABIO provides a set of multi-regional physical supply-use and input-output tables covering global agriculture and forestry. The work is based on mostly freely available data from FAOSTAT, IEA, EIA, and UN Comtrade/BACI. FABIO currently covers 192 countries, 121 processes and 130 commodities for 1986-2013.
